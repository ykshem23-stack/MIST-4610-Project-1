## Problem Description
This project presents a comprehensive relational database model that organizes and connects key social, economic, environmental, and cultural data across global regions and their respective countries. The model is built around a hierarchical structure linking regions, countries, and cities, allowing for an integrated view of global relationships. Each country serves as the central entity in the schema and is connected through one-to-one relationships to detailed national-level tables, including Economy, Education, Health, Demographics, Environment, and Labor Force. These tables store critical indicators such as GDP, education enrollment rates, population density, and mortality statistics, enabling multidimensional analysis of development and performance across nations. In addition, the model incorporates many-to-many relationships with Language and Currency entities, reflecting the cultural and financial interconnections between countries. Through a set of analytical SQL queries, the project enables exploration of relationships between key factors such as education and wages, GDP and environmental efficiency, tax rates and economic growth, and population density and productivity. Overall, this database provides a powerful framework for global data analysis, supporting insights into economic trends, sustainability efforts, and cross-regional development patterns.
